# horiseon_web

## Description

A learning opportunity to enhance an existing code base to make it more accessible using best practice standards for accessibility in web design.
This practice will ensure inclusivity is baked into the design in future greenfield projects, as well as, supporting similar changes to other code
base(s) that require inclusion, but were not originally designed for it.

## Installation

You may clone the repository for access to the project files directly to copy/paste as needed. You may also fork the repository to utilize git actions to deploy as needed to support your workflows.

Since this is a static code project it may be deployed on any hosting platform supporting static code projects supporting html, css, and javascript including cloud providers:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/host-static-website/)
- [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website)

Additionally, if your preference is more hands-on, you can deploy manually to:

- [IIS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/creating-websites/scenario-build-a-static-website-on-iis)
- [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/appdev/deployment.html)
- [Apache Http](https://fullstackdeveloper.guru/2021/04/08/how-to-deploy-html-javascript-code-to-apache-http-server/)

## Usage

This web project is currently deployed [Here](https://ericroys-school.github.io/FSF-Module01-Challenge/)

The outcome of the project is to deliver a webpage that looks like the mock-up (see below) and incorporates the learned concepts for accessibility.
